Summary: The mini app fetches a user's following feed and renders a Farcaster-style, image-first card list with multi-image horizontal scroll.

## Next tasks
- Add pagination (use Neynar cursor) to load more than 25 casts
- Create a setup screen for Inner and Outer Circle selection
- Enrich cards with counts: likes, recasts, replies (and maybe timestamps)
- Minor UX polish: skeleton loaders, error toasts, and better empty state

## What we've done so far
- Project converted to TypeScript for API/feed logic; cleaned up environment handling
- Implemented `/api/feeds` endpoint that fetches Neynar following feed by `fid`
- Normalized cast data in the API and returned up to 25 items
- Extracted images from casts, prioritizing uploaded images; included link previews as fallback
- Returned all images per cast via `imageUrls` array
- Built `FeedGenerator` to request `{ items }` and render a list of cards
- Designed cards to be image-first and optimized for multiple images with horizontal scroll
- Centered the feed column with a comfortable max width; removed auto-scroll jumps
- Added minimal, readable global CSS for the card look and small animations

## Notes
- The feed currently uses the authenticated Farcaster `fid` if available via the mini app context; otherwise a default
- The app is stable and renders the latest 25 casts; no pagination yet

## Session 2025-09-23
- Implemented mutuals API: `GET /api/mutuals?fid=...` calling Neynar reciprocal followers, returning `{ items: [...] }` with `fid, username, bio, pfp`.
- Fixed types for Neynar mutuals (`ReciprocalResponse`, `ReciprocalFollower`) and corrected mapping.
- Built `CircleSetup.tsx` (client) to fetch mutuals, display a list with toggles, enforce max 5 selections, and persist selections to `localStorage` under `circle:{fid}`.
- Added `/circle` page to render Circle setup and link back to `/`.
- Updated `/api/feeds` to return the full feed as `{ items: [...] }` with robust image extraction.
- Updated `FeedGenerator.tsx` to render a list from `{ items }`, gate fetching until a circle exists, and show an empty-state link to `/circle`.
- Added minimal CSS for mutuals list and iOS-style toggle.
- KBC comment: Feed is showing on developer tool. splash screen is creating issues, maybe I'm just too impatient (confirming that if i'd give it more time the splash screen goes away). No images or other embeds (urls, mini-app screen) are showing. error needs a proper fixing not sending the agent to look at it.
